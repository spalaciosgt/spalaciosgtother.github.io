      <h1>Target Audience</h1>
      <p>
        The target audience for this website and the information it will provide, essentially it is
        for people who wish to mountaineering or climbing, specifically:      
      </p>    
      <ul>
        <li>Enthusiastic citizens who want to do amateur mountaineering.</li>
        <li>Mountaineering athletes who want to know the weather conditions for an expedition.</li>
        <li>Anyone who is interested in knowing the weather conditions in mountains, volcanoes, peaks 
            and others in Guatemala.</li>
      </ul>      

      <h1>Personas</h1>
      <ol> 
        <li>Andrés is an amateur mountaineer, but he belongs to the Federation of Mountaineering. 
            With a training group, he organizes one or two expeditions a month to train.</li>
        <li>Ethan is a family man who loves outdoor activities with his family. He and his family 
            go climbing mountains or volcanoes at least one time every three months, it is a 
            family tradition.</li>            
      </ol>

      <h1>Scenarios</h1>
      <ol> 
        <li>Andrés, to ensure the safety and success of his excursions or training expeditions, use 
         <b>mountainweather.org</b> to know what weather conditions will be in the place they will 
            climb, be it a mountain, volcano, peak, or the geographical feature whatever.</li>
        <li>Andrés loves <b>mountainweather.org</b> because apart from the temperature, humidity 
            and climate levels, you can find specific data depending on the type of geographical
            feature, for example if it is a volcano, you can see if there are alerts of suspected
            eruption, seismic fluctuations, etc.</li>
        <li>Ethan loves <b>mountainweather.org</b> because he can get all the data he needs to make 
            sure the weather will be perfect for him and his family and have a perfect experience. 
            He can see very accurate weather predictions.</li>
        <li>Another thing Ethan loves about <b>mountainweather.org </b> is that he can see the opinion 
            or ratings of predictions made rated by other people, which makes him feel more confident 
            in the decisions he will make when traveling and make your outside activities perfect.</li>    
      </ol>
